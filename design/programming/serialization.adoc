== Issues

* how to handle 'dyn Traits'?
** convert to enums?
** what about new implementations in other crates?
* how to validate data?
* how to handle migrating to new versions?
** e.g. the new version requires data for a new feature.
* How to handle mods?

== Serde

* It can't be hidden behind an interface.
** It touches the real code.
