== Issues

* how to handle 'dyn Traits'?
** Convert to enums.
* how to validate data?
* how to handle migrating to new versions?
** e.g. the new version requires data for a new feature.
** With a migration app that works with a parser and not our structs.
* How to handle mods?
** With a mod manager that combines the data from all mods.

== Serde

* It can't be hidden behind an interface.
** It touches the real code.
